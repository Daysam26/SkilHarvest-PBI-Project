### Project Overview
This is the visual summarisation(tables and matrix functions) of Revenue and Unit of Sales generated from GreenTeck sale ledger over a period of 2 years in some particular region. It involve analysing the parameter with modern tools and making a progressive decisions where necessary and given some stories as regard some regionâ€™s performance.

### Data Sources
The primary source of this data is GreenTeck Company's Sales Ledger.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel [Download Here](http://www.microsoft.com)
  - The tools used for data cleaning and preparation
 
- Power BI [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
  - Used in data inspection and cleaning
  - The tools used for table and matrix functions

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
During data cleaning and preparation the following analysis were perform;
- Data Loading, inspection and cleaning
- Creation of additional new column such as;
  - Regional Number by using conditional column
  - Return on Investment (ROI) by using calculated column
- Summarization of Data into Visuals; It includes;
  - Creating range of tables
  - Sum of revenue category in the region
  - Average unit sold and revenue by the region
  - Sum of unit sold by month
  - Total revenue made in 2014 and 2015
  - Sum of unit sold of model by region
  - Total sum of Unit sold
  - Total Revenue etc.

The EDA involves in these Data Analysis are;
1. What is the overall sales trend in the regions 
2. Which period is at the peak of sales
3. Which model is more demanded
4. Revenue generated in 2014 and 2015
5. Generate Fifteen(15) visuals using Table and Matrix

- SUM OF UNIT SOLD OF MODELS BY REGION; This matrix function of data analysis show the total unit sold of models in the region and from the table, model like 3002C has the highest number of unit sold follow by 3002P which need to be recon with and model such as 4500P has lesser number unit sold.

- TOTAL SUM OF UNIT SOLD; With call of card function we have Seven hundred and eighty six thousand, six hundred and seventy eight(786,678) as total Unit sold in six regions within year 2014 and 2015 with the use of Calculated column(measure) in PBI Data analysis. 

- NUMBER ASSIGN TO REGION; This table show the number of regions in their ascending assign number using Conditional column in PBI Data analysis. Which made us to no the number of regions we have.

- SUM OF UNIT SOLD BY MONTH; Here are total of unit sold in each month of the year from January till December to ascertain which month has the highest number of  unit sold and months like first half of the year all maintain highest number of unit sold.

### Recommendation
During the analysis, the following actions are recommended;
1. More focus need to be shifted to areas such as;
  - Regions such as; South East,North west, North central
  - Line of Business such as; Pinter, copier and parts sales
2. Investment and Promotion of Manpower, Various market strategies during off peak period, 2nd half (July- December) of the year to enhance output.
3. Public sensitization on modern use of Computer set 
4. Enhance logistics and staff welfare
